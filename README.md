Sorting Algorithms Performance Analysis
This C project shows the performance of sorting algorithms.

Those sorting algorithms are:

Selection Sort

Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Counting Sort

Radix Sort


Note

So this program tells you the time,the switches and comparisons that each sorting algorithms makes on a run.This sorts the lines from a imput.txt ,i mean it takes a line it sorts it(for files with 100000 lines with 100000 numbers per line it would be kinda messy to have an output file with all the sorted data). I made this to work with matrixes of nxn ,sorting each line.

This was done on a 100x100 input.
